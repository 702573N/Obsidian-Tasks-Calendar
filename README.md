Dataview Snippet To Show Tasks In Different Calendar Views

## Story
All Obsidian and Task Plugin users love the program. What has been set up with the Task Plugin is just great and helps so many people to organize their work. However, just listing tasks according to certain criteria is sometimes a bit boring. To get a quick visual impression of one's workday/workweek/workmonth, a calendar view would be ideal. To be honest, I'm too stupid to program my own plugins for Obsidian, but I know some Javascript, so I programmed this Dataview snippet. I hope to offer many people a good addition to the Task Plugin and hope for an integration into the Task Plugin someday. But I'm sure there are better programmers out there, who can make my code, which is probably horrible for professionals, much better.

## Setup
1.  Install "Dataview Plugin" from the external plugins
2.  Create a new folder in obsidian a paste the files "view.js" and "view.css" into it

3.  Create a new note or edit an existing one and add the following code line:

    ```dataviewjs
    '''dataviewjs
    dv.view("tasksCalendar", {pages: "", view: "month", options: "noIcons"})
    '''
    ```
 
 4. There are 3 different variables to set path/location as "pages, calendar view style as "view" and visibility of note icons as "options"
 
    ```
    pages: ""
    # get all tasks from all notes in obsidian
    
    pages: "Task Management/Work"
    # custom folder
    
    view: "month"
    # Month calendar
    
    view: "week"
    #  Week calendar, Agenda calendar
 
    options: ""
    # Typical Task plugin icons in front of each task
    
    options: "noIcons"
    # Hide Task plugin Icons in front of each task
    ```
    
5. In each note file you can set a custom "color" and a custom "icon" to show up in the calendar. To do this, you only need to enter the following metadata in the note header.

    ```
    ---
    color: "#bf5af2"
    icon: "ðŸ§« "
    ---
    ```
    
    The color should be a hex color to work properly. This color is set as text-color and semi-transparent background-color. The icon itself is placed in front of each task to help identify where this task comes from.
